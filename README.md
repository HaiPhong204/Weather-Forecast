# Weather-Forecast

##### Weather-Forecast is a simple weather application based on Google's weather API. Users can view information about countries and cities on the map and perform searches. Subsequently, they can access detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and current weather conditions. Furthermore, the application provides extended hourly and 6-day weather forecasts. Additionally, the app presents statistical data, such as average temperature, humidity, wind, cloud cover, etc., in the form of bar charts. Lastly, it utilizes CoreData technology to store data locally, allowing users to access previous data even when they are offline.
